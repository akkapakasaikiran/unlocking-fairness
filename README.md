This is a paper presentation of *Unlocking Fairness: a Trade-off Revisited* by Wick et al. ([paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/373e4c5d8edfa8b74fd4b6791d0cf6dc-Abstract.html)), you can find it here: https://akkapakasaikiran.github.io/unlocking-fairness/.

I made this for [CS689](https://sites.google.com/site/harishguruprasad/teaching/topics-in-ml-iitb-aug-2021) (*Machine Learning: Theory and Methods*), an amazing course I took in my final year (Autumn 2021) at IIT Bombay. It was offerred by [Prof. Harish Guruprasad Ramaswamy](https://sites.google.com/site/harishguruprasad/home), who was visiting IITB for a semester.
